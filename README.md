# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

## The Project

For this project we had to create an employee tracker application. The application is in the style of a CMS (Content Management System), the application was to be built from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, inquirer, MYSQL2, and console.table. This application wont be deployed so will also have a walkthrough video to demonstrate its functionality and all of the acceptance criteria being met.

## User Story

```md
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```

## Acceptance Criteria
